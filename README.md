# CSE-CS1.6
Do not expect this to stay the same for long.
I will be constantly updating this map and so it may change.
The bsp is the exported map and rmf is the project file.
You can play the map in game by copying the bsp file into the map folder of the game.
For editing, you'll require the .rmf file.
